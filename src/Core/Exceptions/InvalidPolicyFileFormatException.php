/**
 * Thrown when a policy file contains invalid JSON or malformed data structure.
 *
 * This exception indicates that the policy file exists and is readable, but contains
 * syntactically invalid JSON or structurally incorrect policy data that cannot be
 * parsed into policy rules. Common issues include malformed JSON syntax, incorrect
 * data types for policy fields, or missing required fields like subject/action/effect.
 *
 * The repository performs fail-fast validation during construction to ensure policy
 * data integrity before any authorization requests are processed, preventing runtime
 * failures during security-critical operations.
 *
 * Common causes:
 * - Syntax errors in JSON (trailing commas, unquoted keys, etc.)
 * - Non-array root element (expecting array of policy objects)
 * - Missing required fields in policy definitions
 * - Incorrect data types (string where object expected, etc.)
