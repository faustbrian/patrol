/**
 * Performance-optimized rule matcher using indexed lookups and short-circuit evaluation.
 *
 * Wraps any rule matcher implementation with index-based filtering and optional short-circuit
 * evaluation to reduce the number of rule comparisons during authorization checks. Uses three
 * separate indexes (subject, resource, action) to quickly filter candidate rules before delegating
 * to the underlying matcher for precise evaluation, achieving O(1) candidate lookup instead of O(n).
 *
 * Performance optimizations:
 * - Subject/resource/action indexes for O(1) candidate filtering
 * - Short-circuit evaluation returns immediately on first Deny match
 * - Reduces matcher comparisons from O(n) to O(k) where k << n
