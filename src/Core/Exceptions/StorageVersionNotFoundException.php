/**
 * Thrown when attempting to load a non-existent storage version.
 *
 * This exception indicates that the requested version identifier does not exist
 * in the file-based storage system for the specified storage type. Version-based
 * storage allows maintaining multiple versions of policies or delegations for
 * versioning, rollback, or A/B testing scenarios.
 *
 * The storage system typically organizes versions in directories or files with
 * version identifiers, and this exception is thrown when a requested version
 * cannot be found during load operations.
 *
 * Common causes:
 * - Requesting a version that was never created
 * - Typographical error in version identifier
 * - Version deleted or not yet migrated
 * - Incorrect storage path configuration
 *
 * Resolution:
 * - Verify the version identifier is correct
 * - List available versions using storage directory scanning
 * - Ensure the version was properly saved before attempting to load
 * - Check storage path configuration points to correct location
 *
 * @see VersionedPolicyStorage For version management implementation
