/**
 * Thrown when a policy file exists but cannot be read due to permissions or I/O errors.
 *
 * This exception indicates that the policy file was found in the filesystem but could
 * not be read, typically due to insufficient file permissions or underlying I/O failures.
 * The repository performs fail-fast validation during construction to ensure policy
 * data is accessible before any authorization requests are processed, preventing runtime
 * failures during security operations.
 *
 * Common causes:
 * - Insufficient file permissions (file not readable by application user)
 * - File system I/O errors or disk failures
 * - File locked by another process
 * - Network file system connectivity issues
 *
 * Resolution:
 * - Verify the application has read permissions for the policy file
 * - Check file ownership and permission settings (chmod/chown)
 * - Ensure the disk and file system are functioning properly
 * - If on network storage, verify connectivity and mount status
 *
