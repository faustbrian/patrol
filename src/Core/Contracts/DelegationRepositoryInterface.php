/**
 * Repository contract for managing delegation persistence and retrieval.
 *
 * Implementations handle storage operations for delegations, including creation,
 * lookup, listing, and cleanup of delegation records. The repository pattern
 * enables flexible storage strategies (database, cache, external service) while
 * maintaining consistent delegation management across the application.
 *
 * Implementations should:
 * - Ensure atomic operations for delegation state transitions
 * - Optimize queries for active delegation lookups (hot path)
 * - Support efficient cleanup of expired/revoked delegations
 * - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed delegations
