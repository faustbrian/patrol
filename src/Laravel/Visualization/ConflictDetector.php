/**
 * Static analyzer for detecting conflicts and issues in authorization policy rules.
 *
 * Performs comprehensive policy analysis to identify potential problems that could
 * lead to unexpected authorization behavior or maintenance difficulties. Detects
 * three categories of issues: allow/deny conflicts (same subject-resource-action
 * with contradictory effects), priority collisions (multiple rules at same priority),
 * and unreachable rules (shadowed by higher-priority rules).
 *
 * Analysis results help policy authors identify and resolve ambiguities before
 * deploying policies to production, preventing authorization bugs and security
 * misconfigurations.
 *
 * ```php
 * $conflicts = ConflictDetector::detect($policy);
 *
 * if (!empty($conflicts['allow_deny_conflicts'])) {
 *     // Handle conflicting allow/deny rules
 *     foreach ($conflicts['allow_deny_conflicts'] as $conflict) {
 *         echo "Conflict: {$conflict['subject']} -> {$conflict['action']} -> {$conflict['resource']}\n";
 *     }
 * }
